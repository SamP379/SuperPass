# SuperPass

## A simple Password Manager application for desktops built with Python. 

SuperPass is a simple password manager built with Python and tkinter that aims to make storing and retrieving passwords quick and easy. It has a simple GUI, unlike other password managers. 

The project was a good oportunity to practise OOP concepts, and to learn about hashing and symmetric key encryption, as well as building a GUI using Python's tkinter library.
