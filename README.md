# SuperPass

## A Password Manager application for desktops built with Python. 

SuperPass is a simple password manager built with Python and tkinter that aims to make storing and retrieving passwords quick and easy. It has a simple GUI, and allows user to store account details
along with their passwords. The user can set a master password and then log in and start saving
