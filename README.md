# SuperPass

## A Password Manager application for desktops built with Python. 

SuperPass is a simple password manager built with Python and tkinter that aims to make storing and retrieving passwords quick and easy. It has a simple GUI and allows users to store account details
along with their passwords. The user can set a master password and then log in and start saving and
viewing their password data.  

The project was a good oportunity to practise OOP concepts, how to work with JSON data, using
encryption and hashing to store password data, and how to build a GUI using Python's tkinter
library.
